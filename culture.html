    <div class="description">
        <p>I have presented 2 flags: one is my ethnicity and the other is where I was born/raised.</p>
        <p>The reasoning I put 2 countries is because for China I will always remain a Chinese person, no matter what I do my ethnicity will always remain the same, and New Zealand is where I was born/raised, it will always stick with me that I was raised in New Zealand as it shapes my personality, how I treat others and also what kind of person I will become when I am older.</p>
        <p>The red in Chinese culture represents wealth and good fortune, that's why there is so much of it decorated among celebrations and festivals.</p>
