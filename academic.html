            <h2>My Academic life.</h2>
            <p>My chosen subjects are electronics, DIT and Business. I choose electronics because I thought it would have related to an electrical engineering degree and I would like to understand more about electrical components and more about that field. I choose DIT because it would further the electronic research field and teach me more about technology. I choose business because I'd like to understand more about my finances, accounting and economics. I hope to get an engineering degree if I graduate university but as of right now I'm not sure of what specifically I want to do when I'm older.</p>

            <h2>My grades right now in school. </h2>
            <p>I get merit-Excellence in some of my classes. The subjects I struggle in are electronics and science mostly. My attendance in school is alright, a bit below where it should be but it's acceptable.</p>
